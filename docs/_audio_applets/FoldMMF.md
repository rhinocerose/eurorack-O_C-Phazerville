# Fold/MMF (mono/stereo)

(TODO: screenshot)

A simple wavefolder with an optional state-variable filter after folding.

The Tilt EQ is simply a combination of the Low-pass and High-pass filter outputs with variable gain balance.

All parameters except Mode can have assigned modulation inputs.

### Parameter
* Fold: Amount of wavefolding in percent. 6% is approximately dry.
* Mode: FOLD, FOLD + LPF, FOLD + HPF, FOLD + BPF, FOLD + Tilt EQ
* Freq: center filter frequency in Hz
* (LPF/BPF/HPF) Res: filter resonance
* (Tilt EQ) LF: gain for the Low Frequency band
* Amp: output gain control
